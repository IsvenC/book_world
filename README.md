# Reading Around the World

This repository plays around with my dataset of books I've read. 

## Background
As an avid bookworm, I wanted to keep track of what I was putting into my brain. Therefore, in 2005 I started writing down every book I read. Once I had filled my first couple of 'book journals', I quickly realised that I would lose track if I didn't put all these books in one place. Thus, my book spreadsheet was born.

With a spreadsheet comes data, and with data comes summary statistics, and with my book reading summary statistics came an understanding of bias. I realised that I overwhelmingly read books by British, American or Swedish authors (being Swedish myself), written since 1980. I was clearly missing out on other countries' stories! 

Therefore, I decided to read a book by an author from every country in the world. Not being in a rush, this is still a work in progress. 

## Mapping my progress

I decided to create a map of my progress. You can explore the full plot via [plotly](https://plot.ly/~cisven/2/number-of-books-read-per-country/ "My book world map on plotly").
